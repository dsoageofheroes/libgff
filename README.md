# libgff

`libgff` is designed to read and write from GFF file from old SSI games.
Some of the work is reversed engineered from the .gff others parts are scoured from resources on the internet. Sorry to all those I wasn't able to give a citation.

`libgff` will provide two tools: 
 * `libgff`: a C library for reading (and eventually writing) gff files. This include text, spells, images, maps information, video, and hooks for interfacing with GPL.
 * `gffmod`: a CLI tool for reading (and eventually writing) gff files.
